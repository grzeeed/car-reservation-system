# Feature Branch: Enhanced Car Management üöó

## üìã Overview
This feature branch implements enhanced car management capabilities for the Car Reservation System, including advanced analytics, bulk operations, map integration, and improved user experience.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Advanced Car Analytics** - Utilization metrics, revenue reports, performance dashboards
- **Bulk Operations** - Multi-car status updates, batch maintenance scheduling
- **Enhanced Location Management** - Interactive maps, geofencing, radius search
- **Improved User Experience** - Real-time updates, mobile responsiveness, advanced filtering

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Enhancements (Days 1-5)

- [ ] `ScheduleMaintenanceCommand` for maintenance planning
- [ ] `AddCarImageCommand` for image management
- [ ] `GetCarAnalyticsQuery` for performance data
- [ ] `GetCarsInRadiusQuery` for location-based search
- [ ] Enhanced validation rules

#### Infrastructure Layer Updates
- [ ] Enhanced repository interfaces with analytics support
- [ ] New `ICarAnalyticsRepository` for reporting
- [ ] Bulk operation implementations
- [ ] Geospatial query support
- [ ] New database configurations

### Phase 2: API Enhancements (Days 3-6)
- [ ] New analytics endpoints
- [ ] Bulk operation endpoints
- [ ] Image upload endpoints
- [ ] Geospatial search endpoints
- [ ] Enhanced error handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Enhancements (Days 5-10)
#### New Components

- [ ] `UtilizationChart` and `RevenueChart` components
- [ ] `CarLocationMap` with interactive markers
- [ ] `BulkActionBar` for multi-selection operations
- [ ] `AdvancedCarFilters` with enhanced search
- [ ] `CarImageGallery` for image management

#### Enhanced Services
- [ ] `analyticsService` for performance data
- [ ] `locationService` for map functionality
- [ ] Enhanced `carService` with bulk operations
- [ ] Real-time update capabilities

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Days 8-12)
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Documentation updates

## üìà Success Metrics
- [ ] Bulk operations support for 50+ cars simultaneously
- [ ] Analytics dashboard loads in <2 seconds
- [ ] Map view with real-time location updates
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for new features
